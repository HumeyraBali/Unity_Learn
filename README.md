# Junior Programmer Pathway - Unity Learn

This section provides an overview of my progress through the Junior Programmer Pathway on Unity Learn. It includes the projects completed, course content, and my learning journey.

## Course Overview

The Junior Programmer Pathway on Unity Learn is designed to equip aspiring game developers with fundamental programming skills using Unity Engine. It covers various topics, including scripting, game mechanics, and project-based learning.

## Course Content

### Create with Code 1

Create with Code 1 is the first course in the Junior Programmer Pathway. It introduces fundamental Unity concepts and C# programming skills through hands-on projects. Key topics covered include:

#### 1. Unity Interface and Project Setup:
- Introduction to the Unity Editor
- Creating and configuring Unity projects
- Navigating the Unity interface
#### 2. GameObjects and Components:
- Understanding GameObjects and their properties
- Adding Components to GameObjects
- Using Transform component for positioning and scaling
#### 3. Scripting with C#:
- Introduction to C# scripting language
- Writing and organizing scripts in Unity
- Basic syntax and control structures in C#
#### 4. Player Movement and Physics:
- Implementing player movement using Rigidbody component
- Understanding physics simulation in Unity
- Adding forces and constraints for player interaction
#### 5. User Interface Design:
- Creating user interfaces with Unity UI system
- Designing buttons, text elements, and panels
- Implementing interactive UI elements
#### 6. Basic Gameplay Mechanics:
- Handling player input for gameplay interactions
- Implementing game mechanics such as collecting objects or triggering events
- Managing game state and progression

### Unity Projects

In this section, you'll find the Unity projects I've created during my journey through the Junior Programmer Pathway. Each project demonstrates the skills learned in the corresponding course.

#### 1. Side-to-Side Car Movement

In this project, I programmed a car to move side-to-side on a floating road, attempting to avoid (or hit) obstacles along the way. Throughout the unit, I became familiar with the Unity editor and workflow, while also learning how to create new C# scripts and implement simple programming logic.

By the end of the unit, I was able to:

- Navigate 3D space and the Unity Editor comfortably.
- Add and manipulate objects in the scene to position them accurately, including the camera.
- Control the layout of the Unity Editor to suit my needs.
- Create C# scripts and apply them to objects.
- Add Rigidbody and Collider components to allow objects to collide realistically.
- Declare variables properly and initialize/assign them with appropriate access modifiers.

#### 2. Plane Control

I used the skills I learned in the driving simulation to fly a plane around obstacles in the sky. I had to get the user’s input from the up and down arrows to control the plane’s pitch up and down. Additionally, I made sure the camera followed alongside the plane so I could keep it in view.

Project Outcome:

- The plane moved forward at a constant rate.
- The up/down arrows tilted the nose of the plane up and down.
- The camera followed along beside the plane as it flew.
- Plane's propeller spin when it's flying

In this project, I reinforced the following skills/concepts:

- Using the Vector3 class to move and rotate objects along/around an axis.
- Using Time.deltaTime in the Update() method to move objects appropriately.
- Moving and rotating objects in scene view to position them the way I wanted.
- Assigning variables in the inspector and initializing them in code.
- Implementing Input variables to control the movement/rotation of objects based on User input.

#### 3. Feed the Animals

In this project, I programmed a top-down game where the objective was to throw food to hungry animals stampeding towards me before they could run past. Through this project, I became much more familiar with some of the most important programming and Unity concepts, including if-then statements, random value generation, arrays, collision detection, prefabs, and instantiation.

Throughout the project, I learned how to:

- Create an if-then statement to implement basic logic in my project.
- Transform a gameobject into a prefab that could be instantiated into the scene.
- Work with prefabs to add efficiencies to my workflows.
- Get user input with GetKey and KeyCode to test for specific keyboard presses.
- Utilize arrays to create an accessible list of objects or values and randomly select an object from that array.
- Randomly generate values to randomize spawn positions.
- Change the camera’s perspective to better suit my game.
- Repeat functions on a timer with InvokeRepeating.
- Write custom methods to make my code more readable.
- Detect collisions and destroy objects that collide with each other.
- Display messages in the console with Debug Log.
  
  By the end of this unit, I was able to create a basic game with the ability to launch projectiles and maneuver the player to keep the game alive.
